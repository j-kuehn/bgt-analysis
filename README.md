# BGT Analysis

This repository contains the Jupyter Notebooks used for my explorative analysis of BGT as part of my bachelor's thesis.
The input data was generated and computed by the Cup Game Simulator [[1](https://github.com/j-kuehn/bgt-analysis)].
The `beta`, `partitions` and `uniform` Notebooks contain the results from the explorative analysis, while the `thesis-figures-*` Notebooks contain the code for the creation of the thesis' figures in Chapter 4.
The compressed tarballs `beta.tar.gz` and `uniform.tar.gz` contain the raw generated data from the Cup Game Simulator with the respective seeds.
